    <p>The remainder of this tutorial and all later course tutorials and project descriptions require you have knowledge
        of the material listed below. Each listed topic contains recommended reading if you are not familiar with the
        topic. </p>
    <ol>
        <li><em><u>Bash Command-Line Shell</u></em>: The git instructions in this assignment and in the <em>Pro Git</em>
            book use bash, a particular command-line shell<a href="#WP2023">[WP2023]</a>. You need to have a basic
            understanding of the Bash shell. If you are <u>not</u> already familiar with Bash, read the short
            introduction at <a class="Citation" href="#WART2021">[WART2021]</a>. </li>
        <li><em><u>Environment Variables</u></em>: Regarding environment variables, you should know what they are and
            how to modify them. In particular knowledge of the PATH environment variable is required. A general
            discussion is found at <a class="Citation" href="#WP2016a">[WP2016a]</a> and with specifics on PATH at <a
                class="Citation" href="#WP2016b">[WP2016b]</a>. The method to modify environment variables differs
            across operating system. See <a class="Citation" href="#Microsoft2025">[Microsoft2025]</a> for Windows or <a
                class="Citation" href="#Apple2025">[Apple2025]</a> for MacOS. </li>
